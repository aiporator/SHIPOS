"""Unit tests for the 4-free-video funnel (config + email template).

Pure-function coverage — no DB / network needed. Verifies:
  - the config has 4 ordered daily slots,
  - source resolution + embed URLs pick youtube > vimeo > drive,
  - "coming soon" slots (no source) are correctly flagged and skipped,
  - the daily drip email renders with the right day/subject/deeplink.
