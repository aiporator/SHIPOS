-- Anti-bombing guard for the newsletter double-opt-in flow.
--
-- Surfaced by the Phase-1 security review: without rate limiting,
-- an attacker could send thousands of confirmation mails to a victim
-- (mail-bombing). Resend's own limits are per-account, not per-victim.
-- This RPC is called from the newsletter-subscribe Edge Function
-- BEFORE the Resend send and BEFORE the row-update, so a denied
-- request is a true no-op.
--
-- Caps:
--   per email   - one DOI mail every 5 minutes
--   per IP      - max 10 distinct emails per rolling 1 hour window
--
-- Pending: this migration is not yet applied to prod (Supabase MCP
-- was disconnected during the security pass). Apply at the start of
-- the next session, then ship the matching newsletter-subscribe
-- Edge Function update that already lives in the function's source.
